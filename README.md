# Intersectable Subway Tracks

This mod adds the ability to intersect subway tracks with roads and pathways. This was done at 3 in the morning so I'm not bothered to look into removing the electric rail in the middle.
Also the surface below subway tracks looks a bit different then that of roads so you might notice a slight color difference.
I hope you have fun with this.
